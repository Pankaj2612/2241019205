// If you have N eggs, then you have N/12 dozen eggs, with N%12 eggs left over. (This is
// essentially the definition of the / and % operators for integers.) Write a java program that asks
// the user how many eggs she has and then tells the user how many dozen eggs she has and how
// many extra eggs are left over. A gross of eggs is equal to 144 eggs. Extend your program so
// that it will tell the user how many gross, how many dozen, and how many left over eggs she
// has. For example, if the user says that she has 1342 eggs, and then your program would respond
// with Your number of eggs is 9 gross, 3 dozen, and 10.
