// Some websites impose certain rules for passwords.
// Write a method that checks whether a string is a valid password. Suppose the password rules
// are as follows:
//  A password must have at least eight characters.
//  A password consists of only letters and digits.
//  A password must contain at least two digits.
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter a password and displays Valid Password if the
// rules are followed or Invalid Password otherwise.
