// Write a Java program that illustrates the difference between using string literals and the new keyword for creating String objects. Your program should demonstrate the memory usage implications and how string comparison behaves differently in each case



public class Q1 {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
    String str = "hello";
    String s = new String("Hello");

    

   }
}
