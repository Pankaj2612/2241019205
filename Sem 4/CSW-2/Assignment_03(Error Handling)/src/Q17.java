// Implement a Java program that involves dynamic data structures such as linked lists or
// trees, where elements are stored in arrays. Introduce scenarios, where accessing
// elements beyond the bounds of the array backing the data structure results in
// ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Your task is to implement bounds checking and
// handle these exceptions effectively while maintaining the integrity of the data structure
